                      Cabbage can store well in a hydrator drawer.<br>
                      You can put the cabbage in a plastic bag to help retain moisture but it isn't totally necessary. Handle your cabbage with care. If you use only a partial head, make sure to tightly wrap the remainder and put into the fridge.

                      The easiest way to store fresh garlic at home is at room temperature in mesh bags. Fresh garlic is best stored in dry, dark places.<br>
                      The ideal temperature to store garlic is about 60–65°F (15–18°C) in mild humidity.

                      Proper air circulation and a small amount of moisture will keep your lettuce crisp and fresh. The easiest (and most effective) way to do this is to line a sturdy glass or plastic container with a few paper towels, then scatter your greens on top. Top with a matching lid and refrigerate.
